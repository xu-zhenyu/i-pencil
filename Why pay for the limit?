In the github, the public version is for free, but the private version is a charging service, that is odd. 
Because nobody can do more than a team. 
Especially in the technology area, sharing the knowledge is usually means getting more. 
Why not consider the github as a blog? and it will make no sense if a blog is not open.

The knowledge, method and idea of one human is limited, limit calls for commit. 
Myriad of commits brings infinite. So why should you pay for the limit, 
and resist the infinite for free? 
ultimately, that is something about your mind is narrow or broad.
